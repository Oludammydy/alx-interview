# N queens

The N queens puzzle is a challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NxN chessboard.

On a chessboard, the queen can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally
or diagonally.Thus, to solve the puzzle, each queen must be placed on its own
row, column and diagonal.

This is most efficiently solved using a backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is
a general algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems that
incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate i.e.,
backtracks as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed
to a valid solution.

## Usage

```nqueens N```

where N is the number of queens.
      - N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
      - the program prints every possible solution to the problem in the format
        shown below

```
$ ./0-nqueens 4
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
```

Each inner list represents the coordinates of a queen in the NxN chessboard.
