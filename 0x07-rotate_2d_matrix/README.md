Rotate 2D Matrix

This task involves rotating a 2d matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in-place i.e., without creating a new matrix. The strategy employed in my solution is: 
1. First reflecting the matrix along the leading diagonal or negative slope diagonal. 
2. 2. Rotating the resulting matrix along the middle.
